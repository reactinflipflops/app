# App

The goal is to build a travel guide for cities. We start out pretty simple and extend it step by step. By the end of the week we will do a showcase. Show us how you implemented your travel guide and especially the aha-moments while building it.

## Ideas

- list all the locations
- search locations by name
- filter the search by labels
- show images
- split into a list page and detail page
- add reviews
- show a map on the detail page of every location
- show a map on the list page with markers
- preview the list entry when hovering a marker

## Bonus

- use ReactVR
- implement fetching and storing the data on a server
